# How to play
## Windows / OSX / Linux
Number Game was created with [löve](https://love2d.org/). Specifically version 11.4. For more information on how to run löve games see [this](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) article on the wiki.

## Android
I am currently in the process of publishing on the play store, In the meantime there's an APK in the releases that you can install. Your phone will complain that it's from an untrusted developer. You will 
probably need to enable installing apps from unknown sources.

Alternatively you can install [Löve for android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.love2d.android&hl=en&gl=US). There are instructions there on how to run a game.

Even more alternatively, You can download the [löve android build setup](https://github.com/love2d/love-android) and build your own apk with [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

## iOS
I have no plans to support IOS, But theoretically the game should work on iOS. You'd just have to figure out how to [build](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started#iOS) it
